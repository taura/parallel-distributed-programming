<ul>
<li>Define a problem you want to get high performance for and apply what
you have learned in the class to achieve high performance. The problem
may be one that arises in your research or one that interests you. It
must be one for which you have a good prospect for applying
parallelization or vectorization. Think of good parallel algorithms to
get good performance. Apply multicore parallelization, GPU
parallelization and/or vectorization, understand what is the maximum
performance achievable, and investigate how close your implementation
is.</li>
</ul>
<h1 data-number="2" id="how-to-choose-the-problem"><span
class="header-section-number">2</span> How to Choose the Problem</h1>
<ul>
<li>You are encouraged to seek a problem that is relevant to your
research or that you are highly interested in</li>
<li>That said, if you have no idea what problem you want to work on,
here are some suggestions</li>
<li>Simulation
<ul>
<li>Solve a Poisson equation with Finite Diffence Method</li>
<li>Solve a Poisson equation with Finite Element Method</li>
<li>Solve a Schrödinger equation with Density Functional Theory</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Big Data Processing
<ul>
<li>Build Suffix Array for large text or Gnome sequence</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Machine Learning
<ul>
<li>Train MLP</li>
<li>Train a Convolutional Neural Network</li>
<li>Train a Transformer</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Either way, you are encouraged to use this opportunity to
<em>understand</em> the algorithms/computational methods you have been
treating as blackbox</li>
</ul>
<h1 data-number="3" id="rules-about-the-use-of-genai-e.g.-chatgpt"><span
class="header-section-number">3</span> Rules about the Use of GenAI
(e.g., ChatGPT)</h1>
<ul>
<li>You can ask AI to get suggestions
<ul>
<li>e.g., “can you suggest me a computational method for solving
XYZ?”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You can also ask AI to generate a baseline code for the problem you
chose
<ul>
<li>e.g., “can you show me a sequential Python (C++) code for
constructing Suffix Array?”</li>
<li>e.g., “can you show me a sequential Python (C++) code for GPT”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><font color="blue"><em>As a matter of fact, it is instructive to use
AI to obtain the simple baseline code you can easily understand and get
started with</em></font></li>
</ul>
<h1 data-number="4"
id="rules-about-the-use-of-high-level-libraries-and-languages"><span
class="header-section-number">4</span> Rules about the Use of
(High-Level) Libraries and Languages</h1>
<ul>
<li>General rule is that you are not allowed to use libraries that solve
a significant part of the problem on your behalf</li>
<li>For example, you are not allowed to use <code>torch</code> to train
MLP, as it does most important components (e.g., matrix multiplication,
backpropagation, and parameter updates) on your behalf</li>
<li>Along the same line, you cannot use high performance library for
matrix-matrix multipliocation (e.g., BLAS) or a linear equation solver
(PETSc)</li>
<li>Comparing your implementation with one of those libraries is
encouraged</li>
<li>Using languages other than C/C++ is discouraged but allowed, as long
as you can analyze the performance in the machine code level, which is
difficut in scripting languages such as Python</li>
<li>You are generally advised to work on a simple baseline code written
in low-level languages, for which performance analysis at machine code
level is relatively simple</li>
</ul>
<h1 data-number="5" id="what-you-have-to-do-yourself"><span
class="header-section-number">5</span> What You Have to Do Yourself</h1>
<ul>
<li>You have to apply parallelization, vectorization, and other
code-level optimizations by yourself</li>
<li>You have to find the most time-consuming part(s) of the code through
actual measurements by yourself (you can ask ChatGPT which part is
likely to be most time-consuming, but you must witness it by yourself,
through real experiments)</li>
<li>You have to analyze the machine code of the time-consuming part(s)
by actually generating assembly code and seeing them by yourself</li>
<li>You have to do other necessary analysis to reason about the
performance of the code by yourself (ChatGPT won’t be able to do it
anyways, but just in case you might consider asking it something like
“Please reason about the performance of this code”, it would respond to
you with full of hullcinations)</li>
</ul>
<h1 data-number="6" id="what-must-be-in-the-abstract"><span
class="header-section-number">6</span> What Must Be in the Abstract</h1>
<ul>
<li>A brief description of the problem you are going to work on</li>
<li>A prospect of performance optimizations (vectorization,
parallelizations, ILP, etc.) you are going to apply</li>
</ul>
<h1 data-number="7" id="what-must-be-in-the-report"><span
class="header-section-number">7</span> What Must Be in the Report</h1>
<ul>
<li>Description of the problem</li>
<li>Description of the basic algorithm (why it solves the problem it is
supposed to solve)</li>
<li>The code that solves the problem</li>
<li>Reproducing instructions (instructions for compiling and running
your code so that I can reproduce it)</li>
<li>Description of performance optimization you applied
(parallelization, vectorization, etc.)</li>
<li>Experimental results that show your implementation is correct</li>
<li>Experimental results that show the performance of your code</li>
<li>Analysis of performance (in the manner you did it for
<code>pd30_mlp</code> exercise)</li>
</ul>
<h1 data-number="8" id="how-to-submit-the-report"><span
class="header-section-number">8</span> How to Submit the Report</h1>
<ul>
<li>I provided you with an almost empty Jupyter notebook,
<code>pd31_final</code>, just as a uniform means to submit your
work</li>
<li>You can write your report in the Jupyter notebook just as you have
done for <code>pd30_mlp</code>, or put a separate PDF file under the
<code>pd31_final</code> directory; you can mix the two</li>
<li>You should put all your code under the same <code>pd31_final</code>
directory</li>
<li>It is recommended to write the reproducing instructions directly in
the Jupyter notebook as a bash code cell, so that I can easily compile
and run your code, but if you have an issue with composing Jupyter
notebook, you can write it in the PDF file</li>
<li>To submit your work, press the <code>submit</code> button in the
Jupyter, which sends your report (notebook or PDF) and code (everything
under <code>pd3_final</code>, for that matter)
<ul>
<li>the directory should not contain a big file, which may cause a
submission error</li>
<li>if the big file is an essential part of your work you cannot get rid
of, put it elsewhere (e.g., Google drive or OneDrive) and make a link to
it</li>
</ul></li>
<li>After submitting the work in Jupyter, drop a note for the UTOL
assignment (“Final Report”) saying you have submitted your work (as you
have done for earlier assignments)</li>
</ul>
